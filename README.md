These are my notes on Thomas VanDrunen's _Discrete Mathematics and Functional Programming_. My primary goal is to learn Discrete Math where the presentation is geared toward programmers, secondarily to learn some OCaml syntax. So far, these are notes for code that I run in the REPL, so no guarantees that they will output anything when compiled and run.

If you are using OCaml with _Discrete Mathetics and Functional Programming_, as I have been, perhaps you will find this helpful.

If you know a good way of getting SML set up on Fedora that does not involve compiling from source, I would appreciate your help. Yes, I am aware of [SOSML](https://sosml.org/editor?0&).
